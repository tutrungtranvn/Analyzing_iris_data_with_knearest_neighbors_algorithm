Learn K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Classification and build KNN classifier using Python Scikit-learn package.


K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of the topmost machine learning algorithms. KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or wonâ€™t vote. KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach.
