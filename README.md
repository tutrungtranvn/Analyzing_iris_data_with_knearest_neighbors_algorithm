Learn the K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN) and build a KNN classifier using the Python Scikit-learning package.


K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, flexible and one of the leading machine learning algorithms. KNN is used in many applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition, and video recognition. In credit rating, financial institutions will predict a customer's credit rating. In disbursing a loan, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, potential voters are classified into two classes that will vote or not vote. The KNN algorithm is used for both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm is based on a similar feature approach.
